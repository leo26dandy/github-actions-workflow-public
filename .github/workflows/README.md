Key Fixes for Private Repository

1. Critical Configuration Updates Needed
⚠️ MUST UPDATE THESE VALUES:
```
# Line 5: Replace with exact name from your deploy-theme.yml
workflows: ["Deploy Theme"]  # Change this!

# Lines 117-120: Update your actual URLs
site_url=https://your-production-site.com  # Change this!
site_url=https://your-dev-site.com        # Change this!

# Lines 130, 144: Update theme paths
changed_files="wp-content/themes/your-theme/"  # Change this!
```

2. Private Repository Fixes Applied
   - Added required permissions for private repo access
   - Enhanced commit information retrieval using GitHub API
   - Better error handling for missing commit data
   - Improved fallback mechanisms when git commands fail
   - Fixed checkout depth to fetch full history

3. Workflow Flow Issues Addressed
Your workflow should trigger properly now because:
   1. Proper workflow_run trigger - waits for deploy workflow to complete
   2. API-based commit retrieval - works better with private repos than git commands
   3. Fallback mechanisms - handles cases where commit info isn't accessible
   4. Enhanced error handling - won't fail if some data is missing

4. Testing Capability
The workflow_dispatch trigger allows you to test manually:
   - Go to Actions → Your workflow → "Run workflow"
   - Select test parameters
   - Verify email generation works

Setup Checklist
Before deploying:

1. ✅ Update workflow name in line 5 to match your deploy-theme.yml
2. ✅ Update site URLs in lines 117-120
3. ✅ Update theme paths in lines 130, 144
4. ✅ Ensure all email secrets are configured:
   - SMTP_SERVER, SMTP_PORT
   - EMAIL_USERNAME, EMAIL_PASSWORD
   - EMAIL_RECIPIENTS, EMAIL_FROM

Test process:
1. Deploy this updated workflow
2. Run manual test via workflow_dispatch
3. Check if email is received
4. Trigger actual deployment to test real workflow_run

The workflow should now handle your private repository correctly and provide reliable deployment notifications.
